good luck!
Added a basic turn, a function for comparing win/lose cards and the entire player class.
Major things left are a point system (probably to be added to each player object), a ui for spending luck on a roll and graphics for the computer's card choice and the card 'battle' (currently the user can't see what the computer chose). Also making the game not look terrible and possibly bonus cards (no bonus cards implemented yet, and not sure where the framework for them is, but it shouldn't be too terrible).
